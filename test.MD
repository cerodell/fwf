Look at every fire that occurs this season using the eM3 fire data. Take the dates from that perimeter shapefile

Look at the evolution of the fwi over the fire period. 

Find fire where the hourly forecast captured the rapid change in fire

May need to grab nasa data for fire growth per day 

maybe then we could perform MSSA on each fire with a fixed L or time window? 

Break down or unvail some temporal pattern in the fwi system and fire growth
