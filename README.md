Fire Weather Forecast Model 


This project aims to create a  Fire Weather Forecast (FWF) Model. FWF will be
constructed off preexisting fire weather models such as the Fire Weather Index
System (FWI) and the Fire behavior Prediction Model (FBP). The indices that
make each of the models will be calculated using a numerical weather prediction
model WRF-ARW. 


The new FWI System hereafter referred to as FWI-UBC, will be developed using 
equations developed by Van Wagner (1977) and Van Wanger and Pickett (1985). 
The moisture codes that are the foundation of the FWI system the; Fine Fuel 
Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC) and Drought Code (DC), will be
validated against FWI in-situ measurements at weather stations across Canada,
to ensure accuracy of our product. [1] The mentioned moisture codes along with
the; Initial Spread Index (ISI), Buildup Index (BUI) and the Fire Weather 
Index (FWI) will be graphically displayed via FWF online maps encompassing
regions of interest to the user.  Also, for large fires, point-location 
forecast(s) will be disseminated online in Meteogram format. Product variables 
will include maps of high-resolution FWI-system indices and surface weather 
variables such as wind speed/ direction, temperature, and relative humidity
